This demo social networking site allows users learning natural languages to connect to each other. Native speakers of a language teach those learning it by correcting writing samples ("notes").

While largely a standard Rails app, the system for revising notes uses some features of Backbone.js. I used Divise for authentication and the JS library rangy.
